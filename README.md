# Content-based Video Relevance Prediction Challenge
### @ACM Multimedia 2018, Seoul, South Korea

Video relevance computation is one of the most important tasks for personalized online streaming service. Given the relevance of videos and the users watching or searching behaviors, the system can provide personalized recommendations, which will help users to discover more contents of interests. In most online service, the computation of video relevance table is based on the users’ behavior. That is, the system analyzes the user-to-video preference and computes the video-to-video relevance scores using collaborative filtering based methods. However, this kind of method performs poorly on “cold-start” problems - when a new video is added to the library, the recommendation system needs to bootstrap the video relevance score with very little user behavior known. One promising approach to solve “cold-start” is exploiting video content for relevance prediction, i.e. we can predict the video relevance by analyzing the content of videos including image pixels, audios, subtitles and metadata. However, understanding the content of the videos is still a challenging task. The aim of this challenge is to explore efficient ways to do content-based video relevance prediction tasks for recommendation system.
